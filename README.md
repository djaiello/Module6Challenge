# Module6Challenge
Module 6 Challenge
A README.md that describes the purpose of the repository. Although there is no graded written analysis for this challenge, it is encouraged and good practice to add a brief description of your project.


## Background
- Jack loves the PlanMyTrip app. Beta testers love it too. And, as with any new product, they've recommended a few changes to take the app to the next level. Specifically, they recommend adding the weather description to the weather data.

- For this challenge, you will use the weather description data you've already retrieved in this module to enhance the PlanMyTrip app. Then, you'll have the beta testers use input statements to filter the data for their weather preferences, which will be used to identify potential travel destinations and nearby hotels. The beta tester will choose four cities from the list of potential travel destinations to create a travel itinerary. Finally, using the Google Maps Directions API, you will create a travel route between the four cities and a marker layer map.

## What You're Creating
- This new assignment consists of three technical analyses. You will submit the following deliverables:

  - Deliverable 1: Retrieve Weather Data

  - Deliverable 2: Create a Customer Travel Destinations Map

  - Deliverable 3: Create a Travel Itinerary Map
